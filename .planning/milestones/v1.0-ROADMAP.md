# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-11
**Phases:** 1-5
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

From empty repo to deployed showcase in 5 phases: scaffold the Next.js project with design tokens and data model, fill it with Allied-specific AI use case content, add scroll-triggered animations for polish, build a parallel PDF export, then verify everything works on mobile and Vercel. Content quality is the deliverable — everything else serves it.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Design System

**Goal**: Working Next.js project deployed to Vercel (skeleton), design tokens in globals.css, typed data model for use cases, responsive single-page layout structure
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Scaffold Next.js project with Allied design tokens and typed data model
- [x] 01-02: Build responsive single-page layout and deploy skeleton to Vercel

**Details:**
- Next.js 16.1.6 scaffolded with Tailwind CSS v4 using @theme inline pattern (not tailwind.config.ts)
- Allied brand design tokens: navy (#0F2B46), cream (#F5F0EB), gold (#C4A35A), charcoal (#2D2D2D), slate (#64748B)
- System fonts (Georgia serif + system-ui sans) for fast loading
- Typed UseCase, ProcessStep, CategorySection interfaces
- All 10 use cases with Allied-specific content
- Responsive single-page scroll layout: Header, Hero, 3 category sections, Footer
- Skeleton deployed to Vercel at alliedoutdoorsolutions.vercel.app

### Phase 2: Content & Cards

**Goal**: All 10 AI use case cards with real Allied-specific content, hero messaging, category organization (Quick Win / Medium / Strategic), footer CTA
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Build UseCaseCard component and wire all 10 cards into page

**Details:**
- UseCaseCard component with title, subtitle, timeline badge, description, Allied context callout, 3-step process flow, tool badges, ROI estimate
- Single-column card layout for content readability
- Allied context as left-bordered italic paragraph with gold accent
- Process flow with inline SVG arrows and colored step dots (slate/gold/navy)
- 10 cards organized in 3 category sections (3/4/3)

### Phase 3: Animations

**Goal**: Scroll-triggered staggered card entrances, hero entrance animation, animated process visuals on cards, all subtle and professional
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Install Motion, create animated wrappers, wire into Hero/cards/page

**Details:**
- Motion 12.x via motion/react import (SSR-safe)
- 4 animated wrapper components: ScrollReveal, StaggerChildren, HeroEntrance, AnimatedProcessFlow
- Hero entrance: heading slides down, subtitle fades, CTA fades at 0s/0.3s/0.8s
- Cards stagger in on scroll per section (0.1s between each, once-only triggers)
- Process flow dots and arrows animate sequentially on scroll

### Phase 4: PDF Export

**Goal**: Downloadable PDF via button click — cover page + 10 use case pages with professional layout matching brand aesthetic, working on Vercel
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Install @react-pdf/renderer, build PDF document and download button

**Details:**
- @react-pdf/renderer with client-only dynamic import (ssr: false) for Turbopack compatibility
- Navy cover page with gold accents and Libre Baskerville serif headings
- All 10 use case cards with title, timeline badge, description, process flow, tools, ROI
- Download button with loading/error/ready states in Hero section
- Split into outer/inner components for clean SSR boundary

### Phase 5: Polish & Deploy

**Goal**: Production-ready site — fast loading, mobile-verified, OG tags for sharing, clean Vercel URL, PDF confirmed working
**Depends on**: Phase 3, Phase 4
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Add OG meta tags, verify performance, deploy production to Vercel

**Details:**
- OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata in layout.tsx
- Dynamic OG image (1200x630) via Next.js ImageResponse with Allied branding
- metadataBase set to production Vercel URL
- Production deployment verified at 1.28s response time (under 2s target)
- No separate twitter-image.tsx needed (Next.js auto-uses OG image)

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- None — all phases were integer phases

**Key Decisions:**

- Tailwind CSS v4 with @theme inline instead of tailwind.config.ts (create-next-app scaffolds v4 natively)
- System fonts only (Georgia + system-ui) for fast loading
- 10 use cases split 3/4/3 (quick-win/medium-term/strategic)
- No vercel.json needed (Vercel auto-detects Next.js settings)
- Single-column card layout instead of grid for content readability
- Motion 12.x via motion/react import for SSR safety
- Client-only dynamic import for @react-pdf/renderer (Turbopack compatibility)
- Libre Baskerville from Google Fonts CDN for PDF serif headings
- Next.js file-based opengraph-image.tsx for dynamic OG image

**Issues Resolved:**
- Tailwind v4 uses @theme inline instead of config file — adapted design token approach
- Turbopack doesn't support esmExternals: "loose" — used client-only dynamic import instead
- Turbopack doesn't allow re-exported route config — skipped twitter-image.tsx, auto-fallback works
- metadataBase warning — set to production Vercel URL

**Issues Deferred:**
- User wants to rearrange AI systems into proper timelines (content refinement, not blocking)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- page.tsx and Hero.tsx are client components ("use client") to support animated children — could be refactored with more granular client boundaries
