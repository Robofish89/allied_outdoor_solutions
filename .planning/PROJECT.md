# Allied Outdoor Solutions — AI Strategy Showcase

## What This Is

A polished, animated showcase website (deployed on Vercel) and exportable PDF presenting the top 10 AI use cases for Allied Outdoor Solutions — a luxury outdoor living company in Texas. Built as the final deliverable for an AI & Marketing Automation Specialist interview, demonstrating both strategic thinking and hands-on execution capability.

## Core Value

Convince Allied Outdoor Solutions leadership that hiring Gerhard means immediate, tangible AI-driven improvements to their business — from quick wins they'll see in weeks to transformative systems that compound over months.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Research Allied Outdoor Solutions deeply (services, markets, competitors, online presence, pain points)
- [ ] Identify and finalize 10 AI use cases — mix of quick wins (days/weeks to deploy) and long-term plays (months)
- [ ] Build animated showcase website with Next.js + Tailwind, deployed on Vercel
- [ ] Each solution card shows: what it does, animated process visual, specific tech stack/tools, estimated ROI, timeline category (quick win vs long-term)
- [ ] Exportable PDF version of the showcase (same content, print-friendly format)
- [ ] Create GitHub repo and deploy pipeline to Vercel
- [ ] Hero messaging: "Name the problem, I build the solution" positioning
- [ ] Solutions categorized as: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks), Medium-term (1-3 months), Strategic (3-6 months)
- [ ] Each solution specifies implementation approach with real tools (OpenAI, LangChain, Apify, n8n, Make, Pinecone, etc.)
- [ ] Include ROI estimates for each solution (time saved, revenue potential, cost reduction)

### Out of Scope

- Working prototypes or live demos — concept showcase only, timeline too tight
- Actual implementation of any AI system — this is the pitch, not the build
- Internal company data or proprietary information — all based on public research
- Complex backend systems — static/SSG site with animations only

## Context

**The Company:** Allied Outdoor Solutions — luxury outdoor living (patios, pergolas, outdoor kitchens, fire features, pools, landscaping). Operates in Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio. High-ticket residential projects.

**The Interview:** Gerhard is interviewing for AI & Marketing Automation Specialist. This is the final task after 2 interviews — "come up with your top 10 AI use cases without knowing anything about the company." The deliverable IS the differentiator.

**Initial Use Case Ideas (to be refined after research):**
1. RAG-powered website chatbot (answer questions + book consultations from company data)
2. Internal sales assistant RAG agent (process/service knowledge base)
3. Project management dashboard with AI-powered status tracking and alerts
4. Sales process automation (lead qualification, follow-ups)
5. Automated follow-up emails + Google review solicitation agent
6. Contact list reengagement AI (research old leads, find new opportunities)
7. Lead scoring & CRM enrichment (analyse inquiry preferences, prioritise high-value leads)
8. Competitor social media & ad research agent (analyse high-performing content)
9. Lead generation via prospect scraping (Apify) + personalized outreach (LinkedIn, email)
10. TBD — will finalize after company research

**Tech Stack for Solutions (what we'd build with):** OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, LangChain, Pinecone/Weaviate, n8n/Make for automations, Apify for scraping, various CRM integrations.

**Their Markets:** Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio — all major Texas metros. High-income homeowners wanting luxury outdoor spaces.

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: 24-48 hours to research, build, and deploy — speed over perfection
- **Tech Stack (website)**: Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion — deployed on Vercel
- **No Demos**: Animated concept showcases and mockups only — no working AI prototypes
- **Public Info Only**: All research from publicly available sources (website, social media, reviews)
- **Tone**: Strategic advisor who also builds — authoritative but practical, not salesy

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Static showcase site, no working demos | 24-48hr timeline; concept clarity > half-built prototypes | — Pending |
| Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion | Fast to build, great animations, Vercel-native deployment | — Pending |
| Website + PDF dual deliverable | Website for wow factor, PDF for internal circulation at Allied | — Pending |
| Include ROI estimates per solution | Shows business thinking, not just tech thinking | — Pending |
| Mix quick wins + long-term plays | Demonstrates immediate value AND strategic vision | — Pending |
| Research company first, then finalize use cases | Use cases should address real pain points, not generic AI hype | — Pending |
