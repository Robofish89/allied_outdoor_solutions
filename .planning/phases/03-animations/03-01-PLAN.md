<objective>
Add scroll-triggered animations to the showcase: hero entrance, staggered card reveals, and animated process flow visuals on each card.

Purpose: Polish the site from static content into a professional, subtly animated presentation that demonstrates technical execution capability. Animations must feel luxury — subtle, fast, never blocking content.
Output: All 4 animation requirements (CARD-05, ANIM-01, ANIM-02, ANIM-03) satisfied. Motion library installed and wired.

  <name>Task 1: Install Motion and create animated wrapper components</name>

  <action>
1. Install Motion: `npm install motion`
2. Create `src/components/animated/` directory with 4 client components, each with `"use client"` directive and importing from `motion/react`:

**ScrollReveal.tsx** — Generic scroll-triggered fade-in wrapper:
- Uses `useInView` with `{ once: true, margin: "-80px" }` to trigger before element is fully in viewport
- `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 24 }}` → `animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}`
- `transition={{ duration: 0.5, ease: "easeOut" }}`
- Accepts `children` and optional `delay` prop (number, default 0)
- Renders as `motion.div`

**StaggerChildren.tsx** — Container that staggers child animations:
- Uses `useInView` with `{ once: true, margin: "-60px" }`
- Container variants: `hidden: { opacity: 1 }` → `visible: { opacity: 1, transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1, delayChildren: 0.15 } }`
- Child variants: `hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 24 }` → `visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { duration: 0.45, ease: "easeOut" } }`
- Exports both the `StaggerChildren` container component AND a `StaggerItem` child wrapper component
- Container renders `motion.div` with `variants={containerVariants}`, children renders `motion.div` with `variants={childVariants}`

**HeroEntrance.tsx** — Hero-specific entrance animation:
- No scroll trigger needed (above fold, animates on mount)
- Accepts `children`
- Heading wrapper: `initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -16 }}` → `animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}` with `duration: 0.7, ease: [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]`
- Subtitle wrapper with delay 0.3s: `initial={{ opacity: 0 }}` → `animate={{ opacity: 1 }}` with `duration: 0.6`
- CTA wrapper with delay 0.8s: `initial={{ opacity: 0 }}` → `animate={{ opacity: 1 }}` with `duration: 0.5`
- Export three named components: `HeroHeading`, `HeroSubtitle`, `HeroCTA`

**AnimatedProcessFlow.tsx** — Animated process flow for cards:
- Uses `useInView` with `{ once: true, margin: "-40px" }`
- Staggers the process steps: each step (dot + label + arrow) fades in sequentially with 0.12s stagger
- Step animation: `initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 }}` → `animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}` with `duration: 0.35`
- Arrow animation: draws in (opacity 0 → 1) with slight delay after preceding dot
- Accepts `steps: ProcessStep[]` prop (import ProcessStep type from `@/types/use-case`)
- Replicates the exact same visual layout as the current static ProcessFlow in UseCaseCard.tsx (same classes, same StepDot colors, same ProcessFlowArrow SVG) but wrapped in motion elements
- IMPORTANT: Keep the same Tailwind classes and structure as existing ProcessFlow. Only wrap elements in motion.div/motion.span for animation.

**Critical SSR rules (from PITFALLS.md):**
- EVERY file in animated/ MUST have `"use client"` as first line
- Import from `motion/react` NOT `framer-motion`
- Use `initial={{ opacity: 0 }}` pattern so invisible on server → animates on client (prevents flash)
- Keep wrapper components thin — animation logic only, no business logic

**Animation timing rules (from Pitfalls #7):**
- Max duration: 0.7s for any single element
- Stagger delay: 0.1-0.12s between items
- Total visible animation: under 2 seconds for any section
- Subtle transforms only: max 24px translate, no rotation
- `once: true` on all scroll triggers

- `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
- All 4 files exist in src/components/animated/
- Each file has `"use client"` directive
- Each file imports from `motion/react`

  <name>Task 2: Wire animations into Hero, cards, and page layout</name>
  <files>src/components/layout/Hero.tsx, src/components/cards/UseCaseCard.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Hero.tsx** — Add entrance animations:
- Add `"use client"` directive (needed for animated children)
- Import `HeroHeading`, `HeroSubtitle`, `HeroCTA` from `@/components/animated/HeroEntrance`
- Wrap the h1 in `<HeroHeading>`, the subtitle p in `<HeroSubtitle>`, and the "Explore Solutions" CTA div in `<HeroCTA>`
- Remove the existing `animate-bounce` class from the chevron SVG (the HeroCTA fade-in replaces it — add `animate-bounce` back on the SVG INSIDE the HeroCTA wrapper so it bounces after fade-in)
- Keep all existing Tailwind classes and structure unchanged

**UseCaseCard.tsx** — Replace static ProcessFlow with animated version:
- Import `AnimatedProcessFlow` from `@/components/animated/AnimatedProcessFlow`
- Replace the `<ProcessFlow steps={useCase.processSteps} />` call with `<AnimatedProcessFlow steps={useCase.processSteps} />`
- Keep the static ProcessFlow components (StepDot, ProcessFlowArrow, ProcessFlow) in the file but unused OR remove them since AnimatedProcessFlow replicates their rendering. Prefer removing dead code.
- The rest of the card stays unchanged — the card entrance animation is handled by StaggerItem wrapper in page.tsx

**page.tsx** — Add scroll-triggered staggered card reveals and section reveals:
- Add `"use client"` directive (needed because it now uses animated components that are client components)
- Import `ScrollReveal` from `@/components/animated/ScrollReveal`
- Import `StaggerChildren`, `StaggerItem` from `@/components/animated/StaggerChildren`
- Wrap each `<SectionWrapper>` content area: the section heading area gets a `<ScrollReveal>` and the cards div becomes a `<StaggerChildren>` container
- Each `<UseCaseCard>` gets wrapped in a `<StaggerItem>`
- Structure per section:
  ```
  <SectionWrapper ...>
    <StaggerChildren>
      {cards.map(uc => (
        <StaggerItem key={uc.id}>
          <UseCaseCard useCase={uc} />
        </StaggerItem>
      ))}
    </StaggerChildren>
  </SectionWrapper>
  ```
- The SectionWrapper heading/subtitle already provides visual context; the cards stagger in after the section scrolls into view

**prefers-reduced-motion:**
- In each animated component, Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion` by default (reduces to no animation). No extra code needed — Motion 12.x handles this automatically.

**DO NOT:**
- Add animation to the sticky Header component
- Add parallax or complex scroll-linked effects
- Use AnimatePresence (not needed for single-page scroll)
- Add spring physics with bounce — use easeOut curves only
- Animate text content directly (animate containers only)
  </action>
  <verify>
- `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
- `npm run dev` — page loads without hydration warnings in console
- Hero text fades in on page load (heading first, then subtitle, then CTA)
- Scrolling to Quick Wins section: cards stagger in one by one
- Process flow dots/arrows on cards animate when card scrolls into view
- Scrolling back up does NOT re-trigger animations (once: true)
- Total animation time for any section's cards < 2 seconds
  </verify>
  <done>All animations wired: hero entrance, staggered card reveals per section, animated process flows. No hydration errors. Subtle, professional feel.</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Scroll-triggered animations across the entire showcase: hero entrance animation, staggered card reveals in each section, and animated process flow visuals on each card</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: `npm run dev`
    2. Visit: http://localhost:3000
    3. Hero section: heading should fade in from above, subtitle fades in after ~0.3s, "Explore Solutions" CTA fades in after ~0.8s
    4. Scroll down to Quick Wins section: cards should stagger in one by one (fade + slide up, ~0.1s between each)
    5. On each card: the "How It Works" process flow dots and arrows should animate in sequentially
    6. Scroll to Medium-term section: same stagger effect for those 4 cards
    7. Scroll to Strategic section: same stagger for those 3 cards
    8. Scroll back UP: animations should NOT replay (they stay visible)
    9. Check: animations feel subtle and professional, not flashy or distracting
    10. Check: no layout shift or content jumping during animations
    11. Check: no console errors or hydration warnings in browser DevTools
    12. Mobile: resize to 375px width — animations still smooth, no horizontal scroll
