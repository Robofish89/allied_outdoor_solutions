# Roadmap: Allied Outdoor Solutions — AI Strategy Showcase

## Overview

From empty repo to deployed showcase in 5 phases: scaffold the Next.js project with design tokens and data model, fill it with Allied-specific AI use case content, add scroll-triggered animations for polish, build a parallel PDF export, then verify everything works on mobile and Vercel. Content quality is the deliverable — everything else serves it.
