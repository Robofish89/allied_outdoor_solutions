## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Enhanced Visuals

- **EVIS-01**: Interactive project estimator mockup (clickable demo)
- **EVIS-02**: Detailed implementation timeline/Gantt per solution
- **EVIS-03**: Integration architecture diagrams per solution

### Extended Content

- **ECNT-01**: Case studies from similar implementations
- **ECNT-02**: Cost analysis / TCO calculations per solution

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Working AI prototypes/demos | 24-48hr timeline; concept showcase only |
| Dark mode toggle | Doubles design work; pick one theme and nail it |
| Complex page transitions | Unreliable with Next.js App Router SSR; high risk |
| Video backgrounds | Slow loading, mobile issues, sourcing overhead |
| Interactive chatbot demo | Needs backend, API keys, error handling; outside scope |
| Multiple pages/routes | More pages = more things to break; single-page scroll |
| Blog/content section | Not the point; distracts from the 10 solutions |
| Actual implementation of any AI system | This is the pitch, not the build |
