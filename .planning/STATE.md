## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Tailwind CSS v4 with @theme inline instead of tailwind.config.ts | create-next-app scaffolds v4 natively now |
| 01-01 | System fonts only (Georgia + system-ui) | Fast loading, no Google Fonts dependency |
| 01-01 | 10 use cases split 3/4/3 (quick-win/medium-term/strategic) | Matches plan specification and Allied business needs |
| 01-02 | No vercel.json needed | Vercel auto-detects Next.js project settings |
| 01-02 | Alternating cream/white section backgrounds | Visual separation between categories without borders |
| 01-02 | Full viewport hero with centered serif heading | Maximum impact landing experience, luxury feel |
| 02-01 | Single-column card layout instead of grid | Cards are content-heavy, grid would cramp readability |
| 02-01 | Allied context as left-bordered italic paragraph | Visually distinguishes Allied-specific callout from main description |
| 02-01 | Inline SVG arrows for process flow | No external icon library dependency |
